🦠 Zoonotic-Disease-Data-Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
**Zoonotic-Disease-Data-Analysis** focuses on studying and visualizing global data related to zoonotic diseases — diseases transmitted from animals to humans.  
The aim is to understand **disease patterns, yearly trends, and country-wise impacts** using modern data analytics and visualization tools.

The project includes **interactive dashboards** showing total cases, active cases, deaths, case fatality rates, and disease spread across different years and regions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze zoonotic disease data across multiple countries and years.  
- Visualize total cases, deaths, and active cases through interactive charts.  
- Track **case fatality rates** and **yearly case growth trends**.  
- Compare country-wise and disease-wise impact.  
- Support data-driven insights for epidemiological understanding.

## 🧩 Features
- 🌍 **Global Dashboard** — Overview of total cases, deaths, and active cases.  
- 📈 **Yearly Trend Analysis** — Tracks fluctuations in cases and fatalities (2023–2025).  
- 💀 **Case Fatality Rate Visualization** — Monitors CFR across months and years.  
- 🧠 **Country Comparison** — Compares top affected countries like India, USA, China, Indonesia, etc.  
- 🦠 **Disease Breakdown** — Shows contributions of Rabies, Ebola, Monkeypox, and others.  
- 🗺️ **Geographic Mapping** — Interactive map view of total cases worldwide.
